    "## Capstone Proposal\n",
    "Sifan Liu  \n",
    "July, 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Kickstarter is one of the leading crowd-sourcing platform focusing on early-stage funding for creative entrepreneurship. Research has shown 90% of successful projects remianed ongoing ventures <cite data-cite=\"6184930/7NHXWVIC\"></cite> . However, 1 in 2 of the launched projects would fail. What are the key factors that determine the success of a campaign?\n",
    "Business dynamism has been declining across U.S., as a policy analyst, I am personlly interested to see if the analysis could shed some linght on potential policy intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to explore what factors could best explain a successful fundraising campaign on Kickstarter. According to Kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats), success rates vary across 20% - 60% for different categories. Within each category, there are significant variations in terms of the initial amount seeked, the way the project was presented/described, charateristics of the launcher (gender, city, etc. ), or even the day the project went live. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets and Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Webrobots started to web-scrap kickstarter data every month since 2014 and they've made all datasets publicly available in json and csv files (https://webrobots.io/kickstarter-datasets/). Although Kickstarter limits the amount of historic projects you can get in a single run, the active and latest projects are always included. \n",
    "The datasets include the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Location (city, state)\n",
    "2. Name(s) of project launcher\n",
    "3. Pledged\n",
    "4. Status\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benchmark Model\n",
    "_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Design\n",
    "_(approx. 1 page)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.\n",
    "\n",
    ", and discuss how that knowledge could be used to encourage entrepreneurship\n",

    "**Before submitting your proposal, ask yourself. . .**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the proposal you have written follow a well-organized structure similar to that of the project template?\n",
    "- Is each section (particularly **Solution Statement** and **Project Design**) written in a clear, concise and specific fashion? Are there any ambiguous terms or phrases that need clarification?\n",
    "- Would the intended audience of your project be able to understand your proposal?\n",
    "- Have you properly proofread your proposal to assure there are minimal grammatical and spelling mistakes?\n",
    "- Are all the resources used for this project correctly cited and referenced?\n"
